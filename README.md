## Key Insights

### Profitability
- **Profit skewed heavily**: Some products generate high margins while many incur losses (negative profit).
- **Technology category** shows the highest profit, followed by Furniture.

### Discount Effect
- High discount values (up to 80%) significantly erode profit.
- Discounts are **common**, but not always effective for revenue lift.

### Regional Performance
- **West Region** leads in both sales and profit.
- **Central & South** underperform; needs marketing or logistics optimization.

### Product Categories
- **Technology** contributes 40% of all sales.
- **Office Supplies**, despite volume, shows **lowest profit** share.

### Sales Trends Over Time
- Seasonal spikes observed (especially in Q4).
- Tableau dashboard allows **monthly filtering** for strategic planning.

## Recommendations

- Cap excessive discounts beyond 30% unless tied to volume thresholds.
- Prioritize marketing in high-performing regions (**West**) and develop strategies for Central/South.
- Use quantity and re-order analysis to drive **loyalty-based incentives**.
- Focus BI on **profitability heatmaps by category-region combination**.
- Monitor and segment **loss-making transactions** to reduce leakages.
